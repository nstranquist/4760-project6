Running the Project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run "make" to compile the code
3. Execute "./oss" with the following parameters:
  - `-p n` to specify 'n' number of processes to be used. The default is 20.
  - `-l s` to specify 's' as the filename to use for the logging. The default is "oss.log"
  - `-h` to receive a help message from the program. This will also terminate the program.


Project Description:
This program simulates the operating system, ingoring all parts except the memory management portion.
The primary data structure in this program is the "Page Table", which manages the frames and pages of the memory in the OS.
It helps to manage the simulated page faults in the user processes
